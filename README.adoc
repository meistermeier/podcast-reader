= Podcast Feed Parser Lib

Simple library for parsing rss podcast feeds. It may be a tiny little bit over-engineered solution but check out
the goals to understand the intention.

== Build

== Usage

To parse a feed just call `PodcastFeed#getChannel(inputStream)`. You will get a `Channel` object back that represents
 the channel and all items elements.

== ToDo

* Documentation
* Support more tags and fields

== (private) goals

Since this lib solves a simple use case I try to focus aspects:

* The right visibility / access level of components
    ** Only expose what should be used to the api user
* Test / test coverage
* elegant (in a totally subjective way) solution with vanilla Java
