= Podcast Feed Parser Lib

Simple library for parsing rss podcast feeds.

== Build

image:https://travis-ci.org/meistermeier/podcast-reader.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/meistermeier/podcast-reader"]

== Usage

To parse a feed just call `PodcastFeed#getChannel(inputStream)`. You will get a `Channel` object back that represents
 the channel and all items elements.

== ToDo

* Documentation (e.g. adding more information to this readme.)
* Support more tags and fields

== (private) goals

Since this lib solves a simple use case I try to focus aspects:

* The right visibility / access level of components
    ** Don't confuse the user with too much possibilities
* Test / test coverage
* (elegant) solution with vanilla Java
